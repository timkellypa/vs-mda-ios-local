# vs-mda-ios-local
An iOS node module for building a Visual Studio project locally (i.e. the files have already been moved over).

Essentially the same as vs-mda-remote, except that vs-mda-remote assumes the source is located on a separate machine, and copies it over.  This module just bypasses that first step.
